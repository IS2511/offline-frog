# Offline-frog

Offline-frog is a simple discord bot for trigger-based notification from twitch chat.
The bot operates entirely in DMs, no privileged intents required.

Main components:

- [irc](https://crates.io/crates/irc) for twitch chat
- [sqlx](https://crates.io/crates/sqlx) (SQLite) for user settings storage

- Discord tag: `Offline Frog#2640`
- Server: https://discord.gg/BxqXEuVkvz

If you don't want to join my server you can [add the bot to yours](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=760000000000000000&permissions=0&scope=bot).
The bot will have no permissions and will not be able to do anything on your server.
It's there so users of your server can DM it.

After you have a way to DM the bot, send `!help` to get started.

## Usage (self-hosted)

1. Create a discord bot and invite it to your server: https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/

DATABASE_URL=your_url_here # example: `sqlite:local.sqlite?mode=rwc`
```
3. Build with `cargo build --release`
